// The paths a phone fetches to find out whether a network works, and what each one is told.
//
// A phone that joins a network probes a fixed URL before it will treat that network as usable.
// Serving the SPA shell with 200 to those probes -- which is what ot_http.c's asset_get()
// does today, by falling through to "anything else is a client-side route" -- is not one mistake
// but three, and all three land on the owner in the middle of setup:
//
//  * The OS decides the network is captive and opens its sign-in browser. That browser is not
//    the phone's browser: no WebSocket, so /ws never connects and the state page stays blank,
//    and no Web Crypto -- which is moot on http://192.168.4.1 anyway, but the missing
//    WebSocket is not.
//  * The OS owns that window and closes it when it decides the session is done. On this device
//    that is while somebody is typing the password of their house into it.
//  * Android will not mark a network validated while it believes a portal is unresolved, and it
//    only stops believing that when a probe finally answers 204. There is no sign-in step here
//    that would ever produce one -- setup is not sign-in -- so the phone keeps mobile data as
//    its default route, and POST /api/provision leaves the house instead of arriving at the
//    device three metres away.
//
// So every probe is told the network is fine, in the exact bytes its OS compares against, and
// the owner reaches the setup page through DNS instead (ot_captive_dns.h: every name
// resolves to the access point, so anything typed into a real browser arrives here). DO NOT
// "improve" this table by redirecting a probe to the setup page -- that is all three failures
// back, deliberately.
//
// THIS TABLE FIXES THE FIRST TWO. It does not fix the third, and saying that it does was wrong:
// on Android 9 and later, NetworkMonitor runs an HTTPS probe (https://www.google.com/generate_204)
// alongside the HTTP one, and VALID needs the HTTPS half. The DNS half resolves www.google.com to
// the access point, where nothing listens on 443, so that probe fails with connection-refused
// while ours returns 204 -- and success-on-HTTP with failure-on-HTTPS is precisely the input for
// PARTIAL_CONNECTIVITY. The network stays unvalidated, the owner gets "Wi-Fi has limited
// connectivity", and cellular remains the default route until they tap through it.
//
// There is no fix for that from inside a DNS responder and an HTTP table: it would take a TLS
// listener on 443 holding a certificate for www.google.com. The honest statement is two of three,
// and the third is a README sentence -- "if your phone says the Wi-Fi has no internet, tap
// through; that is this device telling the truth about itself".
//
// The cost of the choice, so that it is not discovered later as a bug: no window opens by
// itself. The owner has to open a browser. That is a README sentence and a label on the box;
// the alternative is a form submitted over somebody's mobile data.
//
// Every literal in ot_captive_probe.c was fetched from the live original
// and its Content-Length recorded next to it. This is a byte-comparison protocol on the other
// end -- Windows compares to a string, Apple to a document, Firefox to both -- so an editor
// that normalises a trailing newline breaks provisioning for one vendor and nothing else.
