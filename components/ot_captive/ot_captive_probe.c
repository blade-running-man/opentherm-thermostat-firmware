// Deliberately absent, so that the next reader knows they were considered rather than forgotten:
//
//  * /redirect -- Windows fetches it only after connecttest.txt has already failed, and it exists
//    to be redirected to a portal. Serving it would mean answering the branch above correctly and
//    then contradicting it.
//  * /library/test/success.html -- an older Apple path. Harmless to add, and no device that
//    reaches this firmware still asks for it.
//  * /kindle-wifi/wifistub.html, and the rest of the per-vendor list. Each is one row, and each
//    is one more byte-exact body that nobody here can verify against a device they own.
//  * The OTHER HALF OF THE WINDOWS PROBE, which is not a path at all. NCSI is two questions, not
//    one: the fetch above, and a DNS lookup of dns.msftncsi.com that must come back as
//    131.107.255.255. ot_captive_dns.c answers every name with the access point's own
//    address, so Windows sees its web probe agree and its DNS probe disagree -- one of the shapes
//    that produces the yellow warning triangle rather than "connected". Fixing it means a
//    special-cased name in the DNS responder: a case-insensitive comparison against one string,
//    on the one code path in this firmware that a stranger on the pavement can reach, in exchange
//    for the least likely client here. Considered and declined; if it is ever wanted, it belongs
//    beside the qtype test in ot_captive_dns_reply() and it needs the malformed-name tests
//    of test/test_captive pointed at it first.
//
// Adding a row costs a test edit, because test_the_table_is_seven_paths_and_the_lookup_finds_
// every_one pins the count. That is on purpose: this table is a list of things the firmware
// lies to, and it should not grow by accident.
