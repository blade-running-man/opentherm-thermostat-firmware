// Turning an HTTP Authorization header into a yes or a no.
//
// This is the one component whose entire input is chosen by whoever is attacking the device.
// The setup access point is OPEN, so on it "the client" is anyone in radio
// range; afterwards the device sits on a household LAN, which this firmware refuses to treat
// as a trust boundary. Everything
// below is written for that reader: nothing is copied before its length is known, no answer
// depends on how nearly right a guess was, and no path can turn a device with no password into
// one that accepts a password.
//
// THREE THINGS ARE NOT HERE, and each absence is the design:
//
//  * The stored form of the password. That is ot_config's record -- `1$<iterations>$<salt
//    hex>$<digest hex>`, PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 over mbedtls with a per-password salt carried inside
//    the record (ot_config.h, OT_CONFIG_KDF_ITERATIONS). A SECOND stored format here
//    would not merely duplicate it, it would be destroyed: ot_config_sanitize() ERASES a
//    ui_pw_hash its own parser cannot read, deliberately, so that an unreadable record leaves
//    the device open rather than sealed. A password stored in any other shape would therefore
//    vanish at the next boot. DO NOT add a hash to this component.
//  * Anything that hashes. The verifier arrives as a function pointer, the way ot_config
//    takes its KDF and for the same reason: mbedtls is on the device and not on the host, and a
//    component that cannot build on the host cannot have its parser tested against the input it
//    exists for. ot_auth_device_verifier() is the device's answer and is the only place
//    the two halves are joined.
//  * A lockout. A fixed delay per failed attempt, applied by the caller. Counting failures and
//    refusing afterwards is a denial of service against the owner -- who is the person most
//    likely to mistype -- and the design turns on the owner still being able to get in: the reset
//    button and the USB port are behind the front panel of a running ventilation unit.
//
// NOTHING HERE LOGS, and nothing here may. The whole log ring is served by GET /api/log
// (ot_log.h), which on the open access point is world-readable. That is also why ot_auth_check()
// does not return the parsed
// credential: there is no password in the outcome for a caller to put in a format string by
// accident, only the shape of the failure, which is safe to publish.

// STORE, or an owner sets the longest password the settings page accepts and can then never log

// Milliseconds the caller must wait before answering a failed attempt.
//
// A speed bump, and ONE fact decides both what it buys and what it costs: esp_http_server serves
// all of its sockets from a single task (ot_http.c:406, max_open_sockets = 7). A caller
// that sleeps here stops that task, so the delays do not run side by side -- seven open
// connections do not get seven guesses a second, they queue behind one another and an attacker
// grinding a word list gets one guess per second in total however many sockets they open. The
// same sentence is the price: every OTHER request waits out that second too, which is a lever an
// attacker can pull on purpose, and it is the reason this is one second and not five.
//
// DO NOT reason about this number as though the sockets ran in parallel -- this comment used to,
// and said in one breath that the delay is paid "per CONNECTION" and that one task serves them
// all. The two readings differ by a factor of seven in the attacker's favour, which is enough to
// size the constant against the wrong threat.
//
// One second is chosen against the owner rather than against the attacker: long enough that a
// script grinding through a word list is not worth writing, short enough that a person who
// mistyped their password does not conclude the device has crashed.
