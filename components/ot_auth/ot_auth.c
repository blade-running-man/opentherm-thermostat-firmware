// The one place these two files are allowed to disagree is nowhere. ot_config decides how
// long a password may be SET to; if this buffer were the smaller of the two, an owner would set
// the longest password the settings page accepts and then be unable to log in with it -- on a
// device with no way in over the air and the reset button behind the front panel of a running
// ventilation unit. A compile error is the right way to find that out.

//
// A cap on WORK, not on storage. Nothing here holds the decoded blob any more: the user name is
// dropped as it arrives and the password lands straight in the caller's struct (sink_byte below),
// so an eight-kilobyte header would cost only the walk through it -- but that is still a walk an
// attacker can ask for, and refusing it before the decode is cheaper than during. 512 characters
// is 384 decoded bytes: a 128-character password with 255 characters of user name in front of it,
// which is past anything a browser prompt or a password manager produces, and half of what this
// device's HTTP server will even deliver (sdkconfig.m5stack-nanoc6:1742,
// CONFIG_HTTPD_MAX_REQ_HDR_LEN=1024) -- so it is this file's limit and not a restatement of the
// server's.
//
// DO NOT turn this back into `4 * ((name_max + 1 + pass_max + 2) / 3)` over a buffer that holds
// both halves at once. That arrangement made the SUM the bounded thing, so a 65-character user
// name in front of the CORRECT 128-character password came back TOO_LONG -- and a correct password
// refused is an owner outside a device whose reset button is behind the front panel of a running
// ventilation unit, which is the same loss the _Static_assert above exists to prevent, reached by
// different arithmetic. It also left a gap: sized in encoded characters over a buffer sized in
// decoded bytes, that check admitted a token whose last group landed two bytes past the end -- on
// a stack the device builds without a canary (sdkconfig.m5stack-nanoc6:1212,
// CONFIG_COMPILER_STACK_CHECK_MODE_NONE), so the bound that caught it could be deleted without a
// single assertion in the suite changing its answer.
