// The captive portal, in the two halves of it that can be decided without a network stack.
//
// Half one is a table: seven paths that phones fetch to find out whether a network works, and
// the byte-exact answer each of them wants. Every literal asserted below was taken from the
// live original with curl -- the Content-Length of each is in the comment beside
// it -- because "close enough" is not a thing here: Windows compares the body to a string,
// Apple compares the body to a document, and one trailing newline is the difference between a
// setup that works and a phone that leaves for mobile data.
//
// Half two is a DNS answer built from a query sent by ANYONE IN RADIO RANGE. The access point
// is open by design, the parser has no authentication in front of it, and it runs before the owner
// has ever touched the device. Most of the cases below are therefore malformed packets, and
// they are the reason this parsing lives in a pure function instead of inside a socket loop
// where it could only be reached with a radio.
//
// EVERY DNS CASE BELOW GOES THROUGH guarded_reply(), which puts the datagram against an unmapped
// page. Read the comment on it before writing another one: a malformed-packet test that only
// looks at the return value is a test that passes against a parser with no bounds checking in it,
// and that was measured here rather than assumed.
