/**
 * Input attributes for a value the machine reads and the owner only relays.
 *
 * A Wi-Fi key, an SSID, a hostname, an MQTT topic prefix: none of them is prose, and every
 * helpful thing a mobile keyboard does to prose corrupts them silently. The one that costs
 * the most is capitalisation of the first character of a password -- the device answers
 * "authentication failed", which is exactly what it would say if the owner had mistyped, and
 * nothing on either side can show that the typed string and the sent string differ.
 *
 * Kept in a .ts file of its own, not inline in TextField.tsx, so that the values can be
 * pinned by a test: the suite is plain TypeScript run by node, and node's type stripping does
 * not handle JSX (see pages/settings/tests/harness.ts).
 *
 * DO NOT add `autocomplete` here. It is a per-field decision -- "new-password" on the field
 * that sets the web-interface password, nothing at all on the Wi-Fi key so that a password
 * manager may still offer the household one -- and a blanket value would take that decision
 * away from every field at once.
