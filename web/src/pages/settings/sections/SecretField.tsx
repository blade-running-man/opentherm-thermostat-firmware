/**
 * Password input for a config value the device refuses to send back.
 *
 * GET /api/config returns CONFIG_UNCHANGED in place of a secret that is set,
 * and "" when none is. Rendering the marker into the box would let the user
 * type on the end of it and store "__UNCHANGED__hunter2", so the box
 * is shown empty and the marker stays in state until something is typed:
 *
 *   - never touched  -> state keeps the marker -> device keeps the stored secret
 *   - typed into     -> state holds the new value -> device stores it
 *   - cleared        -> state holds ""           -> device clears the secret
 *
 * The placeholder is the only thing that tells the two empty-looking states
 * apart, so it has to say which one this is -- and there are THREE of them, not two: a stored
 * secret the owner has just emptied is also an empty box, and it means the opposite of "not
 * set". This component cannot see that difference, because it holds only the box; the caller
 * passes `placeholder` from describeSecret(loaded, value), which sees both values and writes
 * the placeholder and the note from the same pair so they cannot disagree. The fallback below
 * is for the Wi-Fi key box, whose empty state means "the network has no key" and has no stored
 * value behind it to delete (../wifi.ts, describeWifiKey).
