/**
 * One answer from the device, rendered at the volume it deserves.
 *
 * The tone comes from errors.ts and nothing here second-guesses it. The point of having four
 * tones is that "this firmware has not implemented that yet" and "this device is broken" must
 * not look the same: half of this API answers 501 or 404 today, and a page that paints those
 * red teaches the owner that red carries no information.
 *
 * The headline is this page's words; the detail is the DEVICE'S, unedited. Only the device
 * knows which field it refused and why -- ot_config_strerror() writes exactly those
 * sentences -- so paraphrasing would throw away the one actionable part of the message.
