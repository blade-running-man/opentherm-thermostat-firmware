// The three attributes that keep a phone out of a password.
//
// Run: node src/pages/settings/tests/verbatim.test.ts
//
// It lives with the settings tests rather than beside the component because the component is
// .tsx and node's type stripping does not do JSX -- see harness.ts. The constant is in a .ts
// file of its own for the same reason, which is also what makes it possible to pin the values
// at all: a set of attributes written inline in TextField.tsx could only be checked by reading
// it.
//
// The failure being prevented: a mobile keyboard capitalises the first letter of a Wi-Fi key,
// the device reports an authentication failure, and nothing anywhere -- not the log, not the
// router, not the form -- shows that the typed password and the sent password differ by one
// bit. It is the least diagnosable support ticket this page can produce.
