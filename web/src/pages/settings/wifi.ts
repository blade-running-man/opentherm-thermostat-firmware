 * the device disappears, which is the likeliest catastrophe

 * word for it -- ot_config_patch_t: "A NULL string means the key was ABSENT... absent
 * leaves the stored value alone, empty clears it" (ot_config.h:365-368). One decoding
 * rule for the network on both routes, and no string on the wire that anything could store.

 * DO NOT collapse the empty case into the absent one. An open network is a network and
